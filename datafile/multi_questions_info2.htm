<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Introductory Info
Company Overview - JencoMart is a global retailer with over 10,000 stores in 16
countries. The stores carry a range of goods, such as groceries, tires, and
jewelry. One of the company&amp;#39;s core values is excellent customer
service. In addition, they recently introduced an environmental policy to
reduce their carbon output by 50% over the next 5 years. Company Background -
JencoMart started as a general store in 1931, and has grown into one of the
world&amp;#39;s leading brands, known for great value and customer service.
Over time, the company transitioned from only physical stores to a stores and
online hybrid model, with 25% of sales online. Currently, JencoMart has little
presence in Asia, but considers that market key for future growth. Solution
Concept - JencoMart wants to migrate several critical applications to the cloud
but has not completed a technical review to determine their suitability for the
cloud and the engineering required for migration. They currently host all of
these applications on infrastructure that is at its end of life and is no
longer supported. Existing Technical Environment - JencoMart hosts all of its
applications in 4 data centers: 3 in North American and 1 in Europe; most
applications are dual-homed. JencoMart understands the dependencies and
resource usage metrics of their on-premises architecture. Application: Customer
loyalty portal LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) application served from the
two JencoMart-owned U.S. data centers. Database - Oracle Database stores user
pro&amp;not; les - 20 TB - Complex table structure - Well maintained, clean
data - Strong backup strategy PostgreSQL database stores user credentials -
Single-homed in US West - No redundancy - Backed up every 12 hours - 100%
uptime service level agreement (SLA) - Authenticates all users Compute - 30
machines in US West Coast, each machine has: - Twin, dual core CPUs - 32 GB of
RAM - Twin 250 GB HDD (RAID 1) 20 machines in US East Coast, each machine has:
- Single, dual-core CPU - 24 GB of RAM - Twin 250 GB HDD (RAID 1) Storage -
Access to shared 100 TB SAN in each location Tape backup every week Business
Requirements - Optimize for capacity during peak periods and value during
off-peak periods Guarantee service availability and support Reduce on-premises
footprint and associated financial and environmental impact Move to outsourcing
model to avoid large upfront costs associated with infrastructure purchase
Expand services into Asia Technical Requirements - Assess key application for
cloud suitability Modify applications for the cloud Move applications to a new
infrastructure Leverage managed services wherever feasible Sunset 20% of
capacity in existing data centers Decrease latency in Asia CEO Statement -
JencoMart will continue to develop personal relationships with our customers as
more people access the web. The future of our retail business is in the global
market and the connection between online and in-store experiences. As a large,
global company, we also have a responsibility to the environment through
`green` initiatives and policies. CTO Statement - The challenges of operating
data centers prevent focus on key technologies critical to our long-term
success. Migrating our data services to a public cloud infrastructure will
allow us to focus on big data and machine learning to improve our service to
customers. CFO Statement - Since its founding, JencoMart has invested heavily
in our data services infrastructure. However, because of changing market
trends, we need to outsource our infrastructure to ensure our long-term
success. This model will allow us to respond to increasing customer demand
during peak periods and reduce costs.</span></p>

Company overview - Helicopter Racing League (HRL) is a global sports league for
competitive helicopter racing. Each year HRL holds the world championship and
several regional league competitions where teams compete to earn a spot in the
world championship. HRL offers a paid service to stream the races all over the
world with live telemetry and predictions throughout each race. Solution
concept - HRL wants to migrate their existing service to a new platform to
expand their use of managed AI and ML services to facilitate race predictions.
Additionally, as new fans engage with the sport, particularly in emerging
regions, they want to move the serving of their content, both real-time and
recorded, closer to their users. Existing technical environment - HRL is a
public cloud-first company; the core of their mission-critical applications
runs on their current public cloud provider. Video recording and editing is
performed at the race tracks, and the content is encoded and transcoded, where
needed, in the cloud. Enterprise-grade connectivity and local compute is
provided by truck-mounted mobile data centers. Their race prediction services
are hosted exclusively on their existing public cloud provider. Their existing
technical environment is as follows: Existing content is stored in an object
storage service on their existing public cloud provider. Video encoding and
transcoding is performed on VMs created for each job. Race predictions are
performed using TensorFlow running on VMs in the current public cloud provider.
Business requirements - HRL&amp;#39;s owners want to expand their predictive
capabilities and reduce latency for their viewers in emerging markets. Their
requirements are: Support ability to expose the predictive models to partners.
Increase predictive capabilities during and before races: </span><span lang=HE

Crowd sentiment Increase telemetry and create additional insights. Measure fan
engagement with new predictions. Enhance global availability and quality of the
broadcasts. Increase the number of concurrent viewers. Minimize operational
complexity. Ensure compliance with regulations. Create a merchandising revenue
stream. Technical requirements - Maintain or increase prediction throughput and
accuracy. Reduce viewer latency. Increase transcoding performance. Create
real-time analytics of viewer consumption patterns and engagement. Create a
data mart to enable processing of large volumes of race data. Executive
statement - Our CEO, S. Hawke, wants to bring high-adrenaline racing to fans
all around the world. We listen to our fans, and they want enhanced video
streams that include predictions of events within the race (e.g., overtaking).
Our current platform allows us to predict race outcomes but lacks the facility
to support real-time predictions during races and the capacity to process season-long
results.</span></p>

InfoCompany overview -EHR Healthcare is a leading provider of electronic health
record software to the medical industry. EHR Healthcare provides their software
as a service to multi- national medical offices, hospitals, and insurance
providers.Solution concept -Due to rapid changes in the healthcare and
insurance industry, EHR Healthcare&amp;#39;s business has been growing
exponentially year over year.They need to be able to scale their environment,
adapt their disaster recovery plan, and roll out new continuous deployment
capabilities to update their software at a fast pace. GoogleCloud has been
chosen to replace their current colocation facilities.Existing technical
environment -EHR&amp;#39;s software is currently hosted in multiple colocation
facilities. The lease on one of the data centers is about to expire.
Customer-facing applications are web-based, and many have recently been
containerized to run on a group of Kubernetes clusters. Data is stored in a
mixture of relational and NoSQL databases (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Redis, and
MongoDB).EHR is hosting several legacy file- and API-based integrations with
insurance providers on-premises. These systems are scheduled to be replaced
over the next several years. There is no plan to upgrade or move these systems
at the current time.Users are managed via Microsoft Active Directory.
Monitoring is currently being done via various open source tools. Alerts are
sent via email and are often ignored.Business requirements -* On-board new
insurance providers as quickly as possible.* Provide a minimum 99.9%
availability for all customer-facing systems.* Provide centralized visibility
and proactive action on system performance and usage.* Increase ability to
provide insights into healthcare trends.* Reduce latency to all customers.*
Maintain regulatory compliance.* Decrease infrastructure administration costs.*
Make predictions and generate reports on industry trends based on provider
data.Technical requirements -* Maintain legacy interfaces to insurance
providers with connectivity to both on-premises systems and cloud providers.*
Provide a consistent way to manage customer-facing applications that are
container-based.* Provide a secure and high-performance connection between
on-premises systems and Google Cloud.* Provide consistent logging, log
retention, monitoring, and alerting capabilities.* Maintain and manage multiple
container-based environments.* Dynamically scale and provision new
environments.* Create interfaces to ingest and process data from new
providers.Executive statement -Our on-premises strategy has worked for years
but has required a major investment of time and money in training our team on
distinctly different systems, managing similar but separate environments, and
responding to outages. Many of these outages have been a result of
misconfigured systems, inadequate capacity to manage spikes in traffic, and
inconsistent monitoring practices. We want to use Google Cloudto leverage a
scalable, resilient platform that can span multiple environments seamlessly and
provide a consistent and stable user experience that positions us for future
growth.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Introductory Info
Company overview - Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer
games for mobile platforms. They have recently started expanding to other
platforms after successfully migrating their on-premises environments to Google
Cloud. Their most recent endeavor is to create a retro-style first-person
shooter (FPS) game that allows hundreds of simultaneous players to join a
geo-specific digital arena from multiple platforms and locations. A real-time
digital banner will display a global leaderboard of all the top players across
every active arena. Solution concept - Mountkirk Games is building a new
multiplayer game that they expect to be very popular. They plan to deploy the
game&amp;#39;s backend on Google Kubernetes Engine so they can scale rapidly
and use Google&amp;#39;s global load balancer to route players to the closest
regional game arenas. In order to keep the global leader board in sync, they
plan to use a multi-region Spanner cluster. Existing technical environment -
The existing environment was recently migrated to Google Cloud, and five games
came across using lift-and-shift virtual machine migrations,with a few minor
exceptions. Each new game exists in an isolated Google Cloud project nested
below a folder that maintains most of the permissions and network policies.
Legacy games with low traffic have been consolidated into a single project.
There are also separate environments for development and testing. Business
requirements - Support multiple gaming platforms. Support multiple regions.
Support rapid iteration of game features. Minimize latency. Optimize for
dynamic scaling. Use managed services and pooled resources. Minimize costs.
Technical requirements - Dynamically scale based on game activity. Publish
scoring data on a near real-time global leaderboard. Store game activity logs
in structured files for future analysis. Use GPU processing to render graphics
server-side for multi-platform support. Support eventual migration of legacy
games to this new platform. Executive statement - Our last game was the first
time we used Google Cloud, and it was a tremendous success. We were able to
analyze player behavior and game telemetry in ways that we never could before.
This success allowed us to bet on a full migration to the cloud and to start
building all-new games using cloud-native design principles. Our new game is
our most ambitious to date and will open up doors for us to support more gaming
platforms beyond mobile. Latency is our top priority, although cost management
is the next most important challenge. As with our first cloud-based game, we
have grown to expect the cloud to enable advanced analytics capabilities so we
can rapidly iterate on our deployments of bug fixes and new functionality.</span></p>

Company Overview - TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and
agricultural industries: about 80% of their business is from mining and 20%
from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in
100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers
more productive. Company background - TerramEarth was formed in 1946, when
several small, family owned companies combined to retool after World War II.
The company cares about their employees and customers and considers them to be
extended members of their family. TerramEarth is proud of their ability to
innovate on their core products and find new markets as their
customers&amp;#39; needs change. For the past 20 years, trends in the industry
have been largely toward increasing productivity by using larger vehicles with
a human operator. Solution Concept - There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles
in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally
on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The
data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust
operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with
new computing modules. Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a
cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of
120 fields of data per second with 22 hours of operation per day, Terram Earth
collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles. Existing
Technical Environment - field and upload via FTP, transform and aggregate them,
and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes time,
aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old. With this data,
TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce
unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is
stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they
wait for replacement parts. Business Requirements - Decrease unplanned vehicle
downtime to less than 1 week, without increasing the cost of carrying surplus
inventory Support the dealer network with more data on how their customers use
their equipment to better position new products and services Have the ability
to partner with different companies `&amp;quot; especially with seed and
fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural business `&amp;quot; to
create compelling joint offerings for their customers. CEO Statement - We have been
successful in capitalizing on the trend toward larger vehicles to increase the
productivity of our customers. Technological change is occurring rapidly, and
TerramEarth has taken advantage of connected devices technology to provide our
customers with better services, such as our intelligent farming equipment. With
this technology, we have been able to increase farmers&amp;#39; yields by 25%,
by using past trends to adjust how our vehicles operate. These advances have
led to the rapid growth of our agricultural product line, which we expect will
generate 50% of our revenues by 2020. CTO Statement - Our competitive advantage
has always been in the manufacturing process, with our ability to build better
vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with
different approaches are constantly being developed, and I&amp;#39;m concerned
that we lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our
industry. Unfortunately, our CEO doesn&amp;#39;t take technology obsolescence
seriously and he considers the many new companies in our industry to be niche
players. My goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market
needs through incremental innovations.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Common Scenario:</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Introductory Info
Company Overview - TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining and
agricultural industries. About 80% of their business is from mining and 20%
from agriculture. They currently have over 500 dealers and service centers in
100 countries. Their mission is to build products that make their customers
more productive. Solution Concept - There are 20 million TerramEarth vehicles
in operation that collect 120 fields of data per second. Data is stored locally
on the vehicle and can be accessed for analysis when a vehicle is serviced. The
data is downloaded via a maintenance port. This same port can be used to adjust
operational parameters, allowing the vehicles to be upgraded in the field with
new computing modules. Approximately 200,000 vehicles are connected to a
cellular network, allowing TerramEarth to collect data directly. At a rate of
120 fields of data per second, with 22 hours of operation per day, TerramEarth
collects a total of about 9 TB/day from these connected vehicles. Existing
Technical Environment - TerramEarth&amp;#39;s existing architecture is composed
of Linux and Windows-based systems that reside in a single U.S, west coast
based data center. These systems gzip CSV files from the field and upload via
FTP, and place the data in their data warehouse. Because this process takes
time, aggregated reports are based on data that is 3 weeks old. With this data,
TerramEarth has been able to preemptively stock replacement parts and reduce
unplanned downtime of their vehicles by 60%. However, because the data is
stale, some customers are without their vehicles for up to 4 weeks while they
wait for replacement parts. Business Requirements - Decrease unplanned vehicle
downtime to less than 1 week Support the dealer network with more data on how
their customers use their equipment to better position new products and
services Have the ability to partner with different companies `&amp;quot;
especially with seed and fertilizer suppliers in the fast-growing agricultural
business `&amp;quot; to create compelling joint offerings for their customers
Technical Requirements - Expand beyond a single datacenter to decrease latency
to the American midwest and east coast Create a backup strategy Increase
security of data transfer from equipment to the datacenter Improve data in the
data warehouse Use customer and equipment data to anticipate customer needs
Application 1: Data ingest - A custom Python application reads uploaded
datafiles from a single server, writes to the data warehouse. Compute: Windows
Server 2008 R2 - 16 CPUs - 128 GB of RAM - 10 TB local HDD storage Application
2: Reporting - An off the shelf application that business analysts use to run a
daily report to see what equipment needs repair. Only 2 analysts of a team of
10 (5 west coast, 5 east coast) can connect to the reporting application at a
time. Compute: Off the shelf application. License tied to number of physical
CPUs - Windows Server 2008 R2 - 16 CPUs - 32 GB of RAM - 500 GB HDD Data
warehouse: A single PostgreSQL server - RedHat Linux - 64 CPUs - 128 GB of RAM
- 4x 6TB HDD in RAID 0 Executive Statement - Our competitive advantage has
always been in our manufacturing process, with our ability to build better
vehicles for lower cost than our competitors. However, new products with different
approaches are constantly being developed, and I&amp;#39;m concerned that we
lack the skills to undergo the next wave of transformations in our industry. My
goals are to build our skills while addressing immediate market needs through
incremental innovations.</span></p>

InfoCompany overview -TerramEarth manufactures heavy equipment for the mining
and agricultural industries. They currently have over 500 dealers and service
centers in 100 countries.Their mission is to build products that make their
customers more productive.Solution concept -There are 2 million TerramEarth
vehicles in operation currently, and we see 20% yearly growth. Vehicles collect
telemetry data from many sensors during operation. A small subset of critical
data is transmitted from the vehicles in real time to facilitate fleet
management. The rest of the sensor data is collected, compressed, and uploaded
daily when the vehicles return to home base. Each vehicle usually generates 200
to 500 megabytes of data per day.Existing technical environment
-TerramEarth&amp;#39;s vehicle data aggregation and analysis infrastructure
resides in Google Cloud and serves clients from all around the world. A growing
amount of sensor data is captured from their two main manufacturing plants and
sent to private data centers that contain their legacy inventory and logistics
management systems. The private data centers have multiple network
interconnects configured to Google Cloud. The web frontend for dealers and
customers is running in Google Cloud and allows access to stock management and
analytics.Business requirements -* Predict and detect vehicle malfunction and
rapidly ship parts to dealerships for just-in-time repair where possible.*
Decrease cloud operational costs and adapt to seasonality.* Increase speed and reliability
of development workflow.* Allow remote developers to be productive without
compromising code or data security.* Create a flexible and scalable platform
for developers to create custom API services for dealers and partners.Technical
requirements -* Create a new abstraction layer for HTTP API access to their
legacy systems to enable a gradual move into the cloud without disrupting
operations.* Modernize all CI/CD pipelines to allow developers to deploy
container-based workloads in highly scalable environments.* Allow developers to
run experiments without compromising security and governance requirements.*
Create a self-service portal for internal and partner developers to create new
projects, request resources for data analytics jobs, and centrally manage
access to the API endpoints.* Use cloud-native solutions for keys and secrets
management and optimize for identity-based access.* Improve and standardize
tools necessary for application and network monitoring and
troubleshooting.Executive statement -Our competitive advantage has always been
our focus on the customer, with our ability to provide excellent customer
service and minimize vehicle downtimes.After moving multiple systems into
Google Cloud, we are seeking new ways to provide best-in-class online fleet
management services to our customers and improve operations of our dealerships.
Our 5-year strategic plan is to create a partner ecosystem of new products by
enabling access to our data, increasing autonomous operation capabilities of
our vehicles, and creating a path to move the remaining legacy systems to the
cloud.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Introductory Info
Company Overview - Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users
organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a website and mobile
application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects
their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through
advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a premium app model. Company Background
- Dress4Win&amp;#39;s application has grown from a few servers in the
founder&amp;#39;s garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a
collocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now
insufficient for the application&amp;#39;s rapid growth. Because of this growth
and the company&amp;#39;s desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to
a full migration to a public cloud. Solution Concept - For the first phase of
their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is considering moving their development
and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery
site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are
not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and
which components they need to change before migrating them. Existing Technical
Environment - The Dress4Win application is served out of a single data center
location. Databases: - MySQL - user data, inventory, static data - Redis -
metadata, social graph, caching Application servers: - Tomcat - Java
micro-services - Nginx - static content - Apache Beam - Batch processing Storage
appliances: - iSCSI for VM hosts - Fiber channel SAN - MySQL databases - NAS -
image storage, logs, backups Apache Hadoop/Spark servers: - Data analysis -
Real-time trending calculations MQ servers: - Messaging - Social notifications
- Events Miscellaneous servers: - Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts, security
scanners Business Requirements - Build a reliable and reproducible environment
with scaled parity of production. Improve security by defining and adhering to
a set of security and Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices for
cloud. Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid
provisioning of new resources. Analyze and optimize architecture for
performance in the cloud. Migrate fully to the cloud if all other requirements
are met. Technical Requirements - Evaluate and choose an automation framework
for provisioning resources in cloud. Support failover of the production
environment to cloud during an emergency. Identify production services that can
migrate to cloud to save capacity. Use managed services whenever possible.
Encrypt data on the wire and at rest. Support multiple VPN connections between
the production data center and cloud environment. CEO Statement - Our investors
are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current
infrastructure. They are also concerned that a new competitor could use a
public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and freeing them to
focus on developing better features. CTO Statement - We have invested heavily
in the current infrastructure, but much of the equipment is approaching the end
of its useful life. We are consistently waiting weeks for new gear to be racked
before we can start new projects. Our traffic patterns are highest in the
mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is
sitting idle. CFO Statement - Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our
quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial
increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next
hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the
next 5 years puts a cloud strategy between 30 to 50% lower than our current
model.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Common Scenario:</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>Introductory Info
Company Overview - Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users
organize and manage their personal wardrobe using a web app and mobile
application. The company also cultivates an active social network that connects
their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through
advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model. The application
has grown from a few servers in the founder&amp;#39;s garage to several hundred
servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of
their infrastructure is now insufficient for the application&amp;#39;s rapid
growth. Because of this growth and the company&amp;#39;s desire to innovate
faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud. Solution
Concept - For the first phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is
moving their development and test environments. They are also building a
disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single
location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can
migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.
Existing Technical Environment - The Dress4Win application is served out of a
single data center location. All servers run Ubuntu LTS v16.04. Databases:
MySQL. 1 server for user data, inventory, static data: - MySQL 5.8 - 8 core
CPUs - 128 GB of RAM - 2x 5 TB HDD (RAID 1) Redis 3 server cluster for
metadata, social graph, caching. Each server is: - Redis 3.2 - 4 core CPUs - 32GB
of RAM Compute: 40 Web Application servers providing micro-services based APIs
and static content. `&amp;quot; - Tomcat Java - - Nginx - 4 core CPUs - 32 GB
of RAM 20 Apache Hadoop/Spark servers: - Data analysis - Real-time trending
calculations - 8 core CPUs - 128 GB of RAM - 4x 5 TB HDD (RAID 1) 3 RabbitMQ
servers for messaging, social notifications, and events: - 8 core CPUs - 32GB
of RAM Miscellaneous servers: - Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts, security
scanners - 8 core CPUs - 32GB of RAM Storage appliances: iSCSI for VM hosts
Fiber channel SAN `&amp;quot; MySQL databases - 1 PB total storage; 400 TB
available NAS `&amp;quot; image storage, logs, backups - 100 TB total storage;
35 TB available Business Requirements - Build a reliable and reproducible
environment with scaled parity of production. Improve security by defining and
adhering to a set of security and Identity and Access Management (IAM) best
practices for cloud. Improve business agility and speed of innovation through
rapid provisioning of new resources. Analyze and optimize architecture for
performance in the cloud. Technical Requirements - Easily create non-production
environments in the cloud. Implement an automation framework for provisioning
resources in cloud. Implement a continuous deployment process for deploying
applications to the on-premises datacenter or cloud. Support failover of the
production environment to cloud during an emergency. Encrypt data on the wire
and at rest. Support multiple private connections between the production data center
and cloud environment. Executive Statement - Our investors are concerned about
our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They
are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to
offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better
features. Our Traffic patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend
evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle. Our capital
expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud
will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully
transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership
(TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a
cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model.</span></p>
